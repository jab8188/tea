<p>
    All types of “true” tea originate from the same plant called, <i>camellia sinensis</i>, this is the botanical name for the tea plant. The tea plant was originated in southern China thousands of years ago and has been cultivated and consumed for hundreds of years. Each tea type develops its own unique characteristics through different harvesting and processing methods. Some teas are steamed while other teas are pan-fired; Along with, some being allowed to become oxidize and the other teas are not. Also, some tea leaves are hand-formed into tightly rolled balls, where other tea leaves are roughly chopped or left to air-dry in their natural shape. A portion of tea leaves are harvested in the first weeks of the spring season and others are harvested in the summer and fall. 
    <br>
    There are many different factors that influence the appearance and flavor of each tea as you have just read above. There has been many specific tea processing methods that have been developed over hundreds of years which give each tea its own characteristics.
