<h1 class="title">Black Tea</h1>

<br><br>

<p>
    Made from the <i>Cameilia sinensis</i> tea plant. To make black tea the leaves are fully or almost fully oxidized before being fired, also known as dried. Some of the popular varieties that people may go for is the Assam tea or the Earl Grey tea. The English Breakfast tea and the Black tea, are historically, the most common in the western world. The many chemical reactions that occur during production produce a dark, very complex tea. All the vegetal qualities of the leaf are gone and replaced with a depth character unparalleled in the food world. Once Produced the liquor ranges from a dark amber in color to a black color, that would rival coffee. Black is primarily produced in China and India. Some examples of black tea is Ginger Peach tea, Organic Earl Grey Tea, and the Organic Classic English Blend tea.
