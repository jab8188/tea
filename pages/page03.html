<h1 class="title">Green Tea</h1>

<br><br>

<p>
    Green tea is made from the <i>Cameilia sinensis</i> tea plant. This tea leaf is unoxidized. Popular varieties for this tea is, Matcha, Dragonwell Green tea, Sencha, and Gunpowder green tea. This a tea that has been allowed to mature and has been picked once it hits the maturity stage. The leaves are then pan fired or steamed, to stop the oxidation process after a very short period. The natural vegetal flavor of the leaf stands out after this process has been completed. often green tea will have a subtle sweetness that is lost when the tea is turned into oolong or black tea. Green tea produces a greenish to yellow liquor color and can range in a bouquet from grassy to floral. Examples of this tea would include but not limited to, Green Passion tea, Immunity (Stress Shield) tea, and Organic Jasmine tea. Green tea is primarily produced in China and Japan.
