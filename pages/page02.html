    Made from <i>Cameilia sinensis</i> tea plant. This one is slightly oxidized for production to make white tea. Some popular varieties include, Silver Needle (Baâ€¦ Yinzhert) and White Peony (Bai Mudan). These are made from immature buds of the tea plant that are picked and processed before they have time to ripen and develop many characteristics, that are normally associated with tea.
